# Notification Issues Analysis

## Identified Problems

### 1. Missing Notification Channels in Android
The GeofenceReceiver.kt tries to use channel "alarm_triggers" but this channel is never created. Only these channels are created in GeofencingService:
- "geofencing_service" - for foreground service
- "live_cards" - for live distance cards

### 2. Service Not Starting Properly
The GeofencingService expects to receive active alarms data but the loadActiveAlarms() method is just a stub that logs a message. No actual alarm data is being loaded or passed to the service.

### 3. Missing Integration with Flutter
The GeofencingService runs independently but has no way to:
- Get active alarm data from Flutter app
- Communicate back to Flutter when alarms are triggered
- Sync state between Flutter UI and native service

### 4. Incomplete Notification Permission Handling
While permissions are declared in AndroidManifest.xml, there's no runtime permission request flow in the Flutter app for Android 13+ POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission.

## Issues to Fix
1. Create "alarm_triggers" notification channel
2. Implement proper alarm data loading in GeofencingService
3. Create method channel communication between Flutter and native service
4. Add notification permission request handling
5. Implement service lifecycle management from Flutter side
